  - Added proper categoryInfo mapping including DRIPS service
  - Category names are now dynamically displayed based on the URL parameter

### 3. Drag & Drop Functionality
- **Fixed**: Appointments can now be dragged to different times/days
- **Implementation**:

  - Appointments show grip icon and become draggable in week view
  - Visual feedback during drag (opacity change, blue highlight on drop zones)
  - Database updates automatically when appointment is dropped
  - Works in both week and month views

### 4. Service Mapping
- **Fixed**: DRIPS now shows as a separate service
- **Implementation**:

  - Used Droplet icon for DRIPS service
  - Proper color scheme (blue) for DRIPS category
